# Contributor Tools for GitHub and StackOverflow

The eventual goal here is to play around with making recommendation algos. I'll do this when I'm less busy.

The first step was to set up the raw feed. There's no `stackoverflow` directory for now, since StackOverflow already has a pretty good digest of your followed tags and you can even have it e-mail you every day. But for some reason, GitHub doesn't have anything similar for stars, so we fix that.

If/when I get to the recommendation algo part, I'll do it for both SO and GitHub.
